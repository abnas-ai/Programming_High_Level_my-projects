## CREATE USER
  CREATE USER name WITH PASSWORD 'xxxx'

## CREATE SUPERUSER
CREATE USER name WITH PASSWORD 'xxxx' SUPERUSER
ALTER USER name WITH SUPERUSER

## DELETE USER
 DROP USER name;
 DROP USER username;

## creating a superuser in SQL
sudo adduser abnas

## entering the database
sudo -u abnas psql

## GRANT PRIVILEGES TO SUPERUSER
ALTER USER johndoe WITH CREATEDB;        -- allow user to create databases
ALTER USER johndoe WITH SUPERUSER;       -- make user a superuser (‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db TO johndoe; -- grant access to a specific DB
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO johndoe; -- grant access to all tables in a specific schema


## ‚úÖ 1. Grant CREATEROLE (can create roles but not superusers)

ALTER USER your_username WITH CREATEROLE;

Example:

ALTER USER johndoe WITH CREATEROLE;

    üîí This lets johndoe create, alter, and drop roles ‚Äî but NOT create superusers.

## ‚úÖ 2. Make the user a SUPERUSER (can do everything)

ALTER USER your_username WITH SUPERUSER;

Example:

## ALTER USER johndoe WITH SUPERUSER;

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with this ‚Äî a superuser can bypass all permissions, drop databases, roles, etc.

‚úÖ Check permissions:
